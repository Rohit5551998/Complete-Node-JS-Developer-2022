# Complete-Node-JS-Developer-2022

This repo covers ZTM's Complete Node Developer 2022 course contents and also several projects that I implemented during this entire span

The deployed version of the final project titled NASA Project can be found [here](https://nasa-backend-service-production.up.railway.app/)

**_NOTE:_**  The application was previously deployed to Heroku but due to the Free Tier shutting down it was moved to Railway. Due to Railway App restrictions the deployed application will only be available for the first 20-21 days of the month.
